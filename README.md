# Hey, I'm Ynntro :D

I started learning how to code back when I was six, thanks to my Dad who is a coding engineer. But I started taking this domain more seriously in 2024.

I am pretty decent with Python, HTML and Linux commands, yet my main goal is to become fluent with Java and learn C++.

I guess I could say that I am learning something new everyday, but procrastination is getting me... *quite* often :)

## My goals for 2025:
* Learn Java and make a little Minecraft plugin
* Learn C++ basics and make some smol cool stuff with it
* Perhaps make a portfolio website

## What you can except from me on GitHub:
I made an account here to be able to keep learning in class and at home without having to take a USB key with all my files everywhere with me lol. So I will mostly just upload random learning stuff and sometimes some actual projects (such as Discord bots, for example).

Hey, I'm Ynntro :D

I started learning how to code back when I was six, thanks to my Dad who is a coding engineer. But I started taking this domain more seriously in 2024.

I am pretty decent with Python, HTML and Linux commands, yet my main goal is to become fluent with Java.

I guess I could say that I am learning something new everyday, but procrastination is getting me... *quite* often :)
